# _D&D Critical Effects Generator_

#### _Website to generate critical effects from a list_

#### By _**Ash Porter (KirbyPaint)**_
### Generated list effects provided by _Forest Jennings_

## Description

_The purpose of this website is to generate critical success and fumble effects for our D&D games. It is a personal project that my roommate has asked me to work on in my off time._
_This project will run in a web browser. Not formatted for mobile devices._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Please use either a currently updated Firefox or Chrome web browser to run the page. These are the only browsers I've tested the page in._

## How To Use

_When a player rolls a critical hit, and confirms the hit, the Dungeon Master simply needs to click on the button denoting whether the hit was a Minor, Major, or Severe hit. Our system has 20-29 as a Minor hit, 30-39 as a Major hit, and 40+ constitutes a Severe hit. Then, choose the damage type (slashing, piercing, bludgeoning, or magical)._
_If the player rolls a fumble, the DM chooses which type of damage they fumbled on, and clicks the button._

## Known Bugs

_Button shadows render improperly on mobile._

## Planned Implementations

* _Pop-up window displaying the currently rolled effect (change requested by Forest)_
