## How To Use

_When a player rolls a critical hit, and confirms the hit, the Dungeon Master simply needs to click on the button denoting whether the hit was a Minor, Major, or Severe hit. Our system has 20-29 as a Minor hit, 30-39 as a Major hit, and 40+ constitutes a Severe hit. Then, choose the damage type (slashing, piercing, bludgeoning, or magical)._
_If the player rolls a fumble, the DM chooses which type of damage they fumbled on, and clicks the button._

## Known Bugs

_(Low Priority) Button shadows render improperly on mobile._

## Planned Implementations

* _Pop-up window displaying the currently rolled effect (change requested by Forest)_
